# Fashion-Object-Image-Classification

Welcome to the Fashion Object Image Classification project repository! This project focuses on the recognition and classification of fashion-related objects such as bags, sneakers, and dresses from images. Leveraging the power of deep learning, we have created a Dense Neural Network (DNN) model to accomplish this task effectively.

Key Features:

Dataset: We trained our model on a diverse and comprehensive dataset comprising images of fashion items, ensuring a wide variety of styles, colors, and designs.

Model Architecture: The heart of this project is a Dense Neural Network (DNN) constructed using TensorFlow and Keras. We utilized the ReLU activation function for hidden layers and softmax activation for the output layer to achieve robust and accurate predictions.

Optimization: To fine-tune our model and expedite convergence, we employed the Adam optimizer, a popular choice for deep learning tasks.

Loss Function: Our model was trained with the sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function, which is well-suited for multi-class classification tasks.

Accuracy: After rigorous training and testing, our model achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 88%, showcasing its proficiency in identifying fashion objects from images.

Usage:

Explore our code to gain insights into the implementation of the Dense Neural Network for image classification.

Feel free to use the provided dataset or adapt the code to your own fashion-related image dataset.

Experiment with different hyperparameters or architectures to further enhance the model's performance.

I am excited to share this project with the community and hope it serves as a valuable resource for those interested in image classification, deep learning, or the fashion industry
